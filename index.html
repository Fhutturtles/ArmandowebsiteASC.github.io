Boreal forests have a significant role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Temperatures in boreal forests are, on average, below freezing. Conifers, spruce, fir, and pine trees are the predominant needle-leaf plant species in boreal forests. Moose and deer are just a couple of examples of large herbivorous mammals in this environment.

      We measure the annual GHG emissions of our global operations, have them verified under the ISO14064 standard, and share them as part of our social-responsibility reporting, including in our social-responsibility report.
      We are committed to reach net-zero climate impact by 2030. We have set science-based targets to reduce our GHG emissions in line with a 1.5°C pathway and will neutralize the impact of our remaining footprint by removing an equivalent volume of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
      We have set science-based emission-reduction targets for direct emissions and indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 1 & 2 emissions1) as well as other indirect emissions (Scope 3 emissions). The targets consist of reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 25 percent by 2025 from a 2019 base year and reducing our Scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel 30 percent per employee over the same timeframe.
      To help achieve these GHG emission-reduction targets, and as a member of the RE100 coalition, we have set a target of purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025.
      We aim to lower indirect emissions (Scope 3) by finding alternatives to travel where we can, and by encouraging colleagues to choose travel options that are better for the environment.
      We target high-environmental standards for new offices and major renovations, such as LEED Gold, Platinum, or equivalent.
      We invest in carbon-reduction projects to offset the emissions we have not yet been able to eliminate. These projects are independently verified to international standards, such as Gold Standard and VCS.

      We are committed to reducing waste across our global operational sites.</p>

      In addition, we engage with suppliers to improve the environmental impact of the products and services we purchase.
      Beyond reducing our own footprint, we conduct research to advance the global debate on a wide range of sustainability and resource productivity topics. Our research provides an evidence base and set of analytical tools to enable sound decision making about sustainable development.
      We seek to put our research into action through pro bono support of environmental not-for-profit organizations.
      Our Sustainability Practice serves clients on a wide range of topics, including the ways in which they can improve their environmental performance and how they can develop more sustainable methods of operation.
      The Shareholders’ Council—our firm’s board—with the support of its subcommittees, oversees our overall environmental-footprint strategy. The director of environmental sustainability is responsible for shaping, maintaining, and ensuring the implementation of our environmental-footprint strategy. The global Social Responsibility team, supported by a council of firm leaders, helps offices and functions in establishing initiatives, infrastructure, and processes that reinforce the environmental strategy.</p>
